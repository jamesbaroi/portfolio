              When you visit this site the site checks for this cookie's key at
              the appropriate storage location (see location). If the cookie
              value does not match the value for this key, indicating that you
              have not accepted the use of this cookie, the site persistently
              displays a policy notice informing you of this site's cookie
              policy. In the absence of this cookie, the site also removes
              elements of the site that would otherwise trigger the use of
              necessary cookies, ensuring that your cookie preference is
              honored. If the cookie value matches the value for this key,
              indicating that you have agreed to the use of necessary cookies,
              the aforementioned policy notice is removed and site elements
              that only trigger the storage of necessary cookies are restored.
